# Number Guesser Project
That's the first Javascript practice project that I made for Codecademy course, it's a number guesser!
How it works:
<ul>
  <li>If the computer number is closer to the game's number the computer wins.</li>
  <li>If the human number is closer to the game's number the human wins.</li>
  <li>If there's a tie the human wins.</li>
</ul>

The repository contains :

<ul>
  <li>The HTML file.</li>
  <li>The CSS file.</li>
  <li>The Javascript file.</li>
</ul>
